<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Skills
like leadership, intuition and knowing other languages are valuable among many
employers. These examples of tacit knowledge can take a while to develop and be
challenging to share with others. Gaining this type of knowledge may help you
differentiate yourself from other candidates in your industry.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>In
this article, we define tacit knowledge, provide examples, explain its
importance in the workplace and discuss how it differs from other types of
knowledge.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
14.0pt;color:#2E75B5'>What is tacit knowledge?</h2>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Tacit
knowledge is information that one gains through personal experience. This
knowledge is subjective, informal and specific to each individual person and
environment. Tacit knowledge also tends to be challenging to share with others.
The type of information might be too expansive or complex to write down,
verbalize, visualize or transfer.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Though
you can develop tacit knowledge through traditional learning methods, such as
studying, most individuals&nbsp;elevate their tacit knowledge through practical
experience, context and training. Employees often develop tacit knowledge
through sales strategies, management styles or presentations. These examples
represent types of knowledge that can be challenging to convey to new hires.
For example, you can teach them the individual elements to use when making a
pitch and allow them to refine their skills under the supervision of a mentor.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
14.0pt;color:#2E75B5'>Tacit knowledge examples</h2>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Here
are some examples of tacit knowledge that might help to illustrate what it
entails:</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Languages</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Learning
a new language is one example of developing your tacit knowledge. Becoming
proficient in a language often requires you to not only study for several years
but also complete immersion training opportunities where you're able to
surround yourself with the language. While you can write down some rules of a
language, it often requires a whole textbook to be thorough and even this work
likely won't cover everything about speaking the language.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Leadership</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt'><span style='font-family:Georgia;
font-size:12.0pt'>Leadership is another example of tacit knowledge because
effective </span><a
href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/leadership-skills?from=careerguide-autohyperlink-en-US"><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>leadership skills</span></a><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'> can be challenging to teach. Good
leaders tend to possess traits like communication, active listening and high
emotional intelligence that don't come as naturally to those without
experience. You can explain to someone what makes a good leader, but much of
effective leading depends on exposure and personality. Even after years of
training, studying and preparing, there are still opportunities for someone to
improve their leadership skills.</span></p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Intuition</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Another
example of tacit knowledge is intuition. Intuition is an innate ability to
understand situations and circumstances without using logic. It's a great skill
for entrepreneurs to possess because it can enable them to identify when the
best time is to launch a new product or understand when it's appropriate to use
a riskier marketing strategy. They might have a challenging time explaining to
someone from a different background or industry how they knew to make those
choices.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Humor</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>The
nuance of humor can make it challenging to explain why something is funny. Good
humor often requires situational understanding, emotional intelligence and
timing that people naturally possess. People from other cultures or backgrounds
might find it challenging to understand why certain jokes get the reactions
they do. Good humor is often innate, but if you want to develop your humor, you
may spend a lot of time observing how others tell jokes. You can apply their
cues to refine your own style. In the workplace, humor can help you alleviate
tense situations and build trust among clients and employees.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Hard skills</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Hard
skills, like playing musical instruments, learning a new sport or developing
natural talents, can also be examples of tacit knowledge. For example, gymnasts
often do complex physical maneuvers like handstands and splits. While it's
possible to explain how to do these things, learning the tacit knowledge
necessary to inform things like muscle memory isn't as easy to share. Practice
and time tend to be the only methods for learning hard skills.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
14.0pt;color:#2E75B5'>Importance of tacit knowledge in the workplace</h2>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Tacit
knowledge often helps individuals differentiate themselves from other
candidates. Employers often value skills like leadership, intuition and knowing
more than one language when filling empty positions. You can use these traits
to demonstrate your ability to perform the job description. Additionally,
employers typically appreciate that they can spend less time and money on your
initial training.</p>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Tacit
knowledge is also useful for organizations looking to become industry leaders.
When an organization has a wide scope of tacit knowledge, it can rely on its
talented pool of employees to develop innovative solutions. An organization can
also recognize its tacit knowledge and develop the appropriate resources to
train new hires as effectively as possible. For instance, a company might
create a standardized sales strategy and give employees opportunities to refine
their pitches.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
14.0pt;color:#2E75B5'>Tacit knowledge versus other types of knowledge</h2>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>There
are many types of knowledge that can aid you in your work, scholastic and
personal life. Tacit knowledge is one of three main types: tacit, explicit and
implicit. Here's how each of them differs:</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Tacit knowledge versus explicit knowledge</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt'><span style='font-family:Georgia;
font-size:12.0pt'>While&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/explicit-knowledge"><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>explicit knowledge</span></a><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;often compliments tacit
knowledge, they have important differences. Explicit knowledge tends to be easy
to write down and share with others and generally occurs when data is
structured, organized, interpreted and processed. Because it's easy to write,
it's also easy to store. In business contexts, explicit knowledge applies to
processes, expectations or vocabulary that organizations can easily transfer to
new hires.&nbsp;Datasheets, employee handbooks, instruction manuals, research
results and white papers are all examples of places where businesses might
store their explicit knowledge.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>Another
difference between explicit and tacit knowledge is accessibility. Explicit
knowledge is often readily available and easy to communicate. Tacit knowledge
can require skill and in-depth explanations to communicate. People may learn
explicit knowledge relatively quickly, whereas tacit knowledge often takes
space, time and practical experience to develop.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt;font-family:Calibri;font-size:
12.0pt;color:#5B9BD5'>Tacit knowledge versus implicit knowledge</h3>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt'><span style='font-family:Georgia;
font-size:12.0pt'>Another type of knowledge is implicit knowledge, which is the
application of explicit knowledge. It's often transferable from one job or
industry to another, gives broader context to explicit knowledge and can
usually provide a helpful platform for new teachings. For example, if you asked
a </span><a
href="https://www.indeed.com/q-team-member-jobs.html?from=careerguide-autohyperlink-en-US"><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>team member</span></a><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'> how to complete a task, they
might outline the various methods or techniques you could use. Their implicit
knowledge could enable them to share the advantages and disadvantages of each
approach, helping you to effectively decide the ideal way to accomplish a task.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:5pt;margin-bottom:12pt'><span style='font-family:Georgia;
font-size:12.0pt'>Often, implicit knowledge happens by accident. As you become
familiar with processes and routines, you can gain a lot of implicit knowledge
of the workplace. Also known as&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/conceptual-skills"><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>conceptual knowledge</span></a><span
style='font-family:Georgia;font-size:12.0pt'>, implicit knowledge is often
applicable to new contexts or jobs. Implicit knowledge differs from tacit
knowledge because implicit knowledge is often easier to synthesize and apply
quickly. You can learn something explicit and use implicit knowledge to improve.
Tacit knowledge is often much more situationally specific.</span></p>
