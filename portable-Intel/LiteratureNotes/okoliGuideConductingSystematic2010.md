> [!red] [In fact, we know of an author of articles in top-level management journals whose routine procedure in developing articles was to develop a hypothesis, collect the data, analyze it, and then at the end seek a theoretical ―background‖ to explain the results he found. (Although this anecdote is an extreme case, it might not be so rare: Boote and Beile (2005, p. 6) observed the same sort of incident among some doctoral students in education.)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K995XS4E?page=6&annotation=ID5M8BGR) Page 5

> 1. To analyze the progress of a specific stream of research (Alavi & Leidner, 2001; Alavi & Joachimsthaler, 1992; Piccoli & Ives, 2005; Venkatesh et al., 2007);

> 3. To review the application of one theoretical model in the IS literature (Alavi & Carlson, 1992; Wade & Hulland, 2004);

> 4. To review the application of one methodological approach in the IS literature (Dubé & Paré, 2003);
