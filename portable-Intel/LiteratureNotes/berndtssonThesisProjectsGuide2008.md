> Cíl projektu je to, co chcete dosáhnout svou prací, což by mělo být něco originálního, přínosného a smysluplného pro danou oblast. Cíl by měl být jasně formulován, specifický, měřitelný, dosažitelný a relevantní. Cíl by měl také reflektovat účely projektu, které mohou být:
> 
> - Učit se více o nějakém tématu
> - Připravit se na pracovní život nebo doktorské studium
> - Přispět k rozvoji znalostí v oboru
> 
> Dokument radí, jak vyvinout cíl projektu v následujících krocích:
> 
> - Vybrat si oblast zájmu
> - Vybrat si problém, na kterém se zaměřit
> - Zkontrolovat kvalitu počátečních nápadů
> - Napsat a odevzdat návrh projektu
> - Zpřesnit počáteční cíl

> - Many projects in computer science and information systems consist of developing new solutions.
> - Such a solution can consist of a new software architecture, method, procedure, algorithm, or some other technique, which solves some problem in a new way, which has some advantage over existing solutions.
> - In a project of this type, it is often necessary to implement the proposed solution, in order to demonstrate that it really does possess the proposed advantages.
> - The goal of the implementation, then, is to demonstrate that the solution has certain properties, or that (under certain conditions) it behaves in a specific way.
> - This implementation often needs to be compared with implementations of existing solutions, before conclusions can be drawn.
> - The implementations of the existing solutions may or may not be done by yourself.

> > [!example]- UseCases
> > for example, if you rely on simulation data and need to implement the simulation model or the simulation tool yourself. In other cases you may implement a system in order to demonstrate that something can be done, or as part of testing a method for systems development.
> 
> > [!important]- Requirement
> > it is necessary to use good software development practice, part of which is to document the implementation well. Since the implementation is part of your method for the project, you also have to show as much of the documentation as is needed in order to convince the reader that the implementation is correct.
> 
> > [!example]- Requirement
> > For example, you might have implemented an algorithm and performed some simulations where you compared it to another algorithm. Maybe you have already described the algorithm very clearly in your report, but in order to convince the reader that your simulation data are meaningful, you must also demonstrate that the simulations were done with a correct implementation of the algorithm.
> 
> In other words, you must convince the reader that the differences observed between the algorithms are not caused by errors in the code.
> ## So, how do you present the implementation in a way which convinces the reader that it is correct?
> 
> An example is to first show the algorithm in pseudo-code and explain relevant parts of the pseudo-code in writing.
> 
> You can then show a graphical representation of the code, using, for example, flowcharts or some other graph format, which is appropriate for the particular algorithm at hand. This graphical representation should also be discussed in the text so that the reader has a very clear understanding of it (and is convinced that you do too).
> 
> Finally, you can present relevant parts of the code, i.e. those parts that contain the key features of the implementation. This technique is particularly useful if you are using the implementation for the purpose of, for example, showing that a programming language or a model lacks (or contains) certain features. In that case, these code examples may be the main part of your data.
> 
> 
> ## Additional tips:
> Where to put code.
> Commenting
> Other information. Depending on the purpose of the implementation, you may have to provide the reader with other information about the software. Examples include hardware and software requirements, user instructions etc.

> In a project with a strong theoretical emphasis, you may have extended or compared existing theoretical models, without testing them in practice. Let us consider the aim and objectives of the first example project in Sect. 5.2.2.
> > [!aim]-
> > The aim of this project was to “extend an already existing theory or model”.
> 
> We assume that you have already collected, read and presented the relevant data (i.e. the existing theory or model).
> 
> 
> > [!objective]-
> > According to the first objective, you should “identify the details of the extension”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to analyse the collected data (e.g. details of possible extensions). In this example, you would identify which features should be included in the extension. You will then need to justify why some features are more relevant than others. The result of this objective is your detailed description of the extension.
> 
> 
> > [!objective]-
> > In the second objective, you should “introduce the extension to the original theoretical model”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to first introduce the extension to the original model. It further implies that you need to verify that the extension is correctly introduced. The result of this objective is a new theoretical model composed of the original theoretical model and the extension.
> 
> > [!objective]-
> > In the third objective, you should “compare the original theoretical model with the extended version”. In order to fulfil this objective you need to compare the two models against some comparison criteria. The result of this objective may be to ascertain whether the new model has better support for some features than the old model.
