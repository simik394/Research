Creating Btrfs snapshots is a great way to protect your data by capturing the state of your filesystem at a specific point in time. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to help you get started:

### Steps to Create Btrfs Snapshots

1. **Identify the Subvolume**: First, identify the subvolume you want to snapshot. You can list all subvolumes with:
    
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs subvolume list /
    ```
    
2. **Create a Snapshot**: Use the `btrfs` command to create a snapshot. For example, to create a snapshot of the root subvolume:
    
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot / /path/to/snapshot
    ```
    
    Replace `/path/to/snapshot` with the desired location for your snapshot.
    
3. **Verify the Snapshot**: List the subvolumes again to verify that your snapshot was created:
    
    ```bash
    sudo btrfs subvolume list /
    ```
    
4. **Automate Snapshots with Snapper**: If you want to automate the process, you can use a tool like Snapper. Install Snapper and create a configuration:
    
    ```bash
    sudo snapper -c root create-config /
    ```
    
    Then, you can create snapshots with:
    
    ```bash
    sudo snapper -c root create --description "Snapshot description"
    ```
