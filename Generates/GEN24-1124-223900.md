**Using Podman Directly with DevContainers**

While DevContainers are primarily integrated with VS Code, you can directly use Podman to start and manage development containers defined in a `devcontainer.json` file. Here's a general approach:

**1. Create a `devcontainer.json` file:** This file defines your development environment, including the base image, extensions, and configuration settings. You can refer to the official Dev Container specification for more details: [invalid URL removed]

**2. Build the Container Image:** Use Podman to build the container image from the `devcontainer.json` file:

Bash

```
podman build -f devcontainer.json -t my-dev-container .
```

**3. Start the Container:** Run the container interactively:

Bash

```
podman run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace my-dev-container
```

- `-it`: Runs the container in interactive mode with a terminal.
- `--rm`: Removes the container after it exits.
- `-v $(pwd):/workspace`: Mounts your current working directory as a volume inside the container.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Persistent Storage:** To persist changes made inside the container, you can use volume mounts or configure persistent storage solutions provided by your container orchestration tool.
- **Network Configuration:** Ensure that the container has the necessary network connectivity to access remote services and repositories.
- **User Permissions:** Configure the container's user permissions to match your local user's permissions.
- **Environment Variables:** Set environment variables within the `devcontainer.json` file to configure the container's environment.

**Using a DevContainer Management Tool:** For a more streamlined experience, consider using a tool like `devcon` to manage DevContainers. This tool can simplify the process of building, starting, and stopping containers based on the `devcontainer.json` file.

**Remember:**

- The exact commands and configuration might vary depending on the specific setup and requirements of your development environment.
- Always refer to the official documentation for the latest information and best practices.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of Podman, you can effectively use DevContainers to create isolated development environments tailored to your specific needs, even without using VS Code.
